				<p> My name is Lam, and I am from Hanoi, Vietnam. I am currently a rising Junior Computer Science major at Earlham College. I personally am a half introvert-half extrovert person because I could be sociable and energetic most of the time, but I could also be adaptable to being alone. I am also a guy who is able to adapt to new environments, because I am not afraid of any challenges (as long as it is acceptable) and I always welcome them with a positive mind. </p>
				<p> I have a lot of hobbies and they really work during such hard times like the coronavirus pandemic. First, I am really crazy about music, even I think of myself as a musicophile. I love listening to different genres, store a huge collection of songs and hardly forget to bring my headphone with me everywhere I go. Because of that, I can sing, play guitar and a little bit piano, and even rap. This helps me a lot when I am frustrated or disappointed at things and really need to hype up. Honestly, I can't count how many times I go down the road listening to music and dance to it. It's the best moment in my life so far. One more thing, I can dance, but I am not suitable for being a professional dancer or a choreographer because I don't have any specific song to dance to passionately. I just simply feel the magical beat and sound of music</p>
				<p> I am a sportsperson who can spend the whole day talking about sport with those I care about and those have the same interest, watching some NBA games and highlights, college football and NFL's games and highlights, or soccer games and highlights from Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Champions League, and so on. I also watch some mixed-martial arts and wrestling matches if I want to experience new sports. I think I am strong because I am aware of being fit from a very young age, and I have to do everything I can to maintain the body that I desire to have by doing exercises at home, going to the gym, playing sports like soccer, basketball, badminton, swimming, etc. A lot of people ask me why I don't play games. Well, I actually play game but you cannot realize: a basketball match is called a basketball game and I play basketball a lot, so at least, I play (basketball) games a lot.</p>
				<p> I am a guy who wants to makes myself better everyday. I read some books that help me learn how to behave like "How to win friends and Influence people", inspire me to live a life that I cannot forget, or push some limits like "Chicken Soup for the Soul". I also spend time watching the news and read (online) newspapers to understand what is going on in the world and give myself some useful lessons. As a Computer Science major, I never stop learning and acquiring knowledge. Last year, after my freshmen year, I slightly had a passion of coding, which was deemed to be lost forever, because Python was intriguing. I spent the whole summer redoing all the assignments from CS128 to understand how Python works and how their semantics are used. Right now, I am confident with my coding skills and I will try learining other programming languages like C, C++, or Java. Last but not least, I entertain myself by watching some English TV shows and basketball videos on Youtube because I can learn more English words (although my English is proficient) and enrich my basketball knowledge </p>
				<p> Well, everything I want to share is listed all above, If you want to know more, please feel free to contact me at <b>Contact</b>. I can guarantee that once you are my friend, it is hard to find a guy like me who is fearless like a warrior, energetic and enthusiastic like a DJ, sarcastic and humorous like Kevin Hart, and never gives up like John Cena.</p>
