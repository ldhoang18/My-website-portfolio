				<p> Below are the lists of what I have done during my teen years. I have to admit that teenage years are the most memorable moments in my life because it marks the development of both my physicality and mentality. No matter how later years turns out, I will never regret anything because I have lived my teenage life at its fullness, the time when my heart was still young and pure. To my teenage years, thank you!</p>

				<h2 class='center'>2013</h2>
				<p>I turned 13 that September. I can feel the change in my body when I became significantly taller than before (rising from 1.42m to 1.52m) and my voice began to sound differently. Besides that, there was nothing special about me then.</p>

				<h2 class='center'>2014</h2>
				<p>It was a smooth year, I guess. I started to be more confident and optimistic than ever because I was inspired by everything: the book that I read (Chicken Soups of Soul), and the songs that I listened to (a lot, but I can only list one that changed my life forever: Shake it Off by Taylor Swift). This was the moment when I realized that I was totally free of doing whatever I want without judgement or caring about other's opinion</p>  
				<p> Notable achievement: Attendant of "I love Vietnamese history" contest, school round, Runner-up.</p>

				<p>Smooth at first, but a little bit incomplete at the end because my Chemistry Final was bad. But looking back, me in 2015 was the same as in 2014, but tended to love studying about social issues. My achievements included:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Went to Kim Lien high school - where I always dreamt of.</li>
					<li>A member of a soccer team competing at the school's tournament</li>

				<p>Another smooth year. I made another big step on my academic career when I qualified for an exchange program to the USA (equivalent to 1 year in high school, but I would be a 12-grader)</p>  
				<ul>
					<li>Member of soccer team, second year</li>
					<li>Qualified for a student exchange program to the US</li> 
					<li>A member of KimLien guitar club</li>

				<p>It was a prep year for my first trip to the USA. I made some notable achievements (academically, of course) that helped me decide a college that I will commit for the next 4 years. First time in the USA was fun and exciting for me as I got to study at a modern school and met an amazing and loving host family.</p>  
				<ul>
					<li>Charity work for poor students in Lao Cai</li>
					<li>6.5 IELTS</li>
					<li>1200 SAT</li>

				<p>This year marked the first time I did not have a chance to celebrate Tet at home, but my time in the USA was unforgettable. I was admitted to 7 colleges and chose Earlham because of its diversity, just like my US high school (actually the scholarship was the main reason). Notable achievements:</p>  
				<ul>
					<li>Admitted to Earlham College</li>
					<li>Graduate from Lakeview High School</li>
					<li>Cerificate of Academic Excellence, signed by US president</li>

				<p>My second semester of my freshman year. I was glad to meet new people and had a good time there (I sometimes call Earlham home). I was still exploring to find who I would be in the future, but there was one thing that never change: I was still upholding the best of me 4-5 years ago. The difference is: I had to take more responsibilities and had to be busier. What I did:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Public Safety student parking reinforcement worker</li>
					<li>IMLeagues Basketball Tournament, Quarter-Finalist</li> 
				</ul>

				<p>My second year at Earlham, I tended to be more mature and not hesitant with everything. I had one of the most productive year in my college life because I continued to try new things. Should the coronavirus not occur, some of my plan would become true</p>  
				<ul>
					<li>Event Staff for Earlham Athletics</li>
					<li>Icelandic Field Studies 2020</li>
					<li>Dance Alloy's first appearance, dancer</li>
